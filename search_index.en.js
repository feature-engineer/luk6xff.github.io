Debugging\nDebugging is like being a detective for software, where you hunt for clues to fix problems in code. GEF makes this detective work easier and more effective, especially when you're dealing with tricky bugs or trying to understand how a program really works. Let's break down how GEF can help you and how to get started with it.\nWhat is GEF?\nGEF is a tool that adds extra powers to GDB, the GNU Debugger, which is a tool many developers use to find bugs in their programs. GEF makes GDB more user-friendly and powerful by adding new features, such as better visuals, more information about your program's status, and tools to check the security of your software.\nWhy Should You Use GEF?\nGEF makes your life easier when you're debugging:\n\nClearer Information: It shows you what's going on in your program more clearly, making it easier to understand problems.\nBetter Control: You get more ways to stop and inspect your program exactly where and when you need to.\nFind Bugs Faster: GEF has special features to help spot common mistakes that can lead to bugs.\n\nGetting Started with GEF\nSetting Up\nFirst, you need GDB installed. Then, to add GEF, you run a simple command in your terminal:\n\nThis command gets GEF set up with your GDB, and you're ready to go!\nUsing GEF\nTo start debugging a program with GEF, you open your terminal and type:\n\nThis command starts GDB like usual, but you'll notice GEF's improvements right away.\nHelpful Features\n\ncontext: This shows a snapshot of what's happening in your program, like what the computer is currently working on and what data it's handling.\nheap: If your program uses dynamic memory (allocating memory during runtime), this command helps you see how that memory is being used or misused.\npattern create / pattern search: These commands help you figure out how data is laid out in memory, which is super useful for finding certain types of bugs.\nchecksec: This command checks the security properties of your executable, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities, such as stack canaries or NX bits.\ngef config / gef save: Customize and save your GEF environment to streamline your debugging sessions, tailoring the tool to your needs.\ndereference: Offers a more intuitive view of pointers and memory addresses, making it easier to navigate through complex structures.\nregisters: Get a quick overview of the current state of CPU registers, which is crucial for low-level debugging\n\nDebugging with GEF: A Quick Example\nImagine you have a program that's not working right, and you suspect it's due to a bug where the program is trying to access memory it shouldn't. Here's how you might use GEF to find that bug:\n\nStart GEF with your program: gdb -q ./buggy_program\nSet a breakpoint: This is like telling GEF, \"Pause here; I want to check something.\" You can do this with the command break main if you want to stop right when the main function starts.\nRun the program: Just type run and hit enter. The program will start and then pause where you set the breakpoint.\nStep through the code: Use the next command to go through your program one line at a time. Watch the context information GEF gives you to see what the program is doing.\nInspect memory: If you think the bug is happening because the program is accessing memory it shouldn't, you can use commands like x/gx, heap chunks, and search-pattern to explore and manipulate memory at runtime, helping uncover issues like memory leaks or corruption.\nScripting: Automate repetitive analysis tasks or implement custom logic for complex debugging scenarios using Python scripts.\n\nThrough this process, GEF gives you a clearer view of what's happening inside your program, helping you spot and fix the bug.\nReal world example\nLet's try to use gef in action:\nI have a following code simulating buffer overflow issue:\n\nDebugging the provided C++ code with GEF (GDB Enhanced Features) will allow you to understand the execution flow, examine variables, and potentially identify vulnerabilities or logical errors. Below are steps on how to debug this C++ program using GEF, focusing on key points like setting breakpoints, stepping through the code, and inspecting the memory and variables.\nStep 1: Compile the Program with Debugging Information\nFirst, compile the C++ program (full example available:HERE): with debugging information enabled (-g) and disable optimizations (-O0) to ensure that you can inspect the source code as is during debugging.\n\nStep 2: Start and analyze GEF with the Program\n\nOpen a terminal and start GEF with your compiled program:\n\n\n\nCheck the binary security flags by checksec:\n\n\nStep 3: Set Breakpoints\nSet breakpoints at key functions to inspect their behavior. For instance, you might want to break at process_credentials to observe how input is handled and at admin_panel to see if it's possible to reach that function.\n\nStep 4: Run the Program\nStart the program within GEF by typing r or run. The program will start and stop at the first breakpoint.\n\nStep 5: Find the ret address of the process_credentials function\nWhen brakpoint is reached, print the address of the stack pointer which contain the return address of process_credentials function. It will be used to overrite it with admin_panel address.\n\nStep 6: Step Through the Code\nUse the next or n command to step through the code line by line. If you want to step into functions (like store_credentials_into_db), use step or s instead.\nStep 6: Inspect Variables and Memory\nAs you reach the std::cin call, you can inspect the contents of buffer and other variables:\n\nIf you want to dereference all the stack entries inside a function context (on a 64bit architecture): p ($rbp - $rsp)/8\nFind the memory address of the buffer array: p &amp;buffer[0]= 0x7fffffffd7b0\nTo examine the content of buffer: x/128c buffer\n\nStep 7: Continue Execution\nAfter inspecting the variables at the first breakpoint, continue execution to see if the second breakpoint (admin_panel) is hit.\n\nStep 8: Experiment with Inputs\nIf you're analyzing the program for vulnerabilities, you might try inputs that could potentially overflow buffer or otherwise manipulate the program's flow. Run\nStep 9: Utilize GEF Commands for Deeper Analysis\nGEF provides commands that are particularly useful for security analysis:\n\npattern create and pattern search to test for buffer overflows.\nheap bins to inspect the heap state if dynamic memory allocation is used elsewhere in the program.\n\nStep 10: Quit GEF\nOnce you're done debugging, you can quit GEF with the quit command.\nMore commands\nAll the available GEF commands available here.\nBonus\nI've also developed an exploit for the provided code using insights from gef. You can locate it here. Please remember to customize the addresses, specifically process_credentials_ret_addr and buffer_addr, to match those on your system.\"\nConclusion\nGEF is like a supercharged version of GDB that makes debugging less of a headache. It's packed with features that give you a clearer view of your program and help you find and fix bugs more efficiently. Whether you're a new developer or have been coding for years, GEF is a valuable tool to add to your software debugging toolkit.\nHappy hacking!\n","id":"https://luk6xff.github.io/posts/gef-tool/","title":"GEF - A better GDB"},"https://luk6xff.github.io/posts/led-clock/":{"body":"A Supercharged LED Clock\nToday, we're diving into one of my latest small projects that's perfect for anyone who loves building and coding.

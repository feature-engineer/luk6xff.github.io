# Concurrency Without Data Races

Rust fully embraces concurrent programming by leveraging operating system threads, mutexes, and channels. Its robust type system is central to transforming numerous potential runtime concurrency errors into compile-time issues. This approach, often termed "fearless concurrency," empowers software engineers to develop concurrent applications with confidence, trusting the compiler to enforce runtime correctness.

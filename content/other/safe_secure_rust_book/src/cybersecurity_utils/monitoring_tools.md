- **Description:** Suricata is a high-performance Network IDS, IPS, and Network Security Monitoring engine. While Suricata itself is not written in Rust, it incorporates Rust for many of its parsers and operations, leveraging Rust's memory safety features to enhance its security posture. Suricata is widely used for real-time intrusion detection (IDS), inline intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM), and offline pcap processing.

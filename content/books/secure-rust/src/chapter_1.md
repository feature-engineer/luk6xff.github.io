# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It aims to provide memory safety without garbage collection, and concurrency without data races. Rust achieves these goals through a set of ownership rules, checked at compile time, without sacrificing performance.

## Background and Motivation

Developed by Mozilla and first released in 2010, Rust has grown rapidly in popularity, offering a viable alternative to traditional systems programming languages like C and C++. Its design eliminates common bugs found in these languages, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and memory leaks.

## Comparison with C/C++

Unlike C and C++, Rust enforces memory safety at compile time. This means many of the common vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs, such as use-after-free errors and data races, are caught before the code is even run. This drastically reduces the potential for security vulnerabilities in Rust programs.

## Example
```rust,editable
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

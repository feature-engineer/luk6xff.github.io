# Cryptography utils written in RUST

### **RustCrypto**

- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto)
- **Description:** The RustCrypto project provides a collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented in pure Rust. It includes libraries for hashes, MACs, ciphers, AEAD, RNGs, public key cryptography, and more. The focus on Rust ensures that these cryptographic primitives and utilities benefit from Rust's compile-time safety and efficiency, which is crucial for security-sensitive applications.


### **RustTLS**

- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/rustls/rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls)
- **Description:** A modern TLS library in Rust. Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security, requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or obsolete cryptography by default.
Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers
